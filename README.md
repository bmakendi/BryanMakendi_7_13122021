# Groupomania

This project was created with Node.js, Express.js and mysql for the backend.

The frontend was created with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), styled-components, react-router and Material UI.

## **Important**

The project was developped on node version 16.

You will also need to have mysql installed, with a database named "groupomania".

```bash
CREATE DATABASE groupomania;
```

Make sure to have your mysql server running before trying to use the app.

You will also need a file named ".env" in the backend directory, so open the example.env in the backend directory and do as it says.

## **How to install and use**

Clone this directory, then do the following :

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend/
npm install
# you can now go back to the backend directory and do the following
npm start
cd ../frontend/
npm start
```

The api runs on local port 8000.

The website will be visible at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## **What is Groupomania**

Groupomania is OpenClassrooms' last project for the web developper course. It was required to use a frontend web framework of choice, and mysql for the database.

The app is a social network made for a company named Groupomnia, where you can sign in (or log in), write posts, see coworkers' posts, visit their profile, edit yours etc.

Features like dark mode and a searchbar were also implemented, so don't hesitate to play around with it !
